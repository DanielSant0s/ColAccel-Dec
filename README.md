# ColAccel-Dec
 A GTA San Andreas Collision Accelerator bin2text decompiler. I've created this little script to debug AcceleratorGen.asi to replace PS2 maps. This isn't finished, so don't rely too much on the data generated by FILENAME_dump.txt.

# Requirements
 Python 3.7(or higher)  
 numpy(use pip install numpy)

# Usage
 ```powershell
 python accel_dec.py FILENAME
 ```
 It will generate a FILENAME_dump.txt with all decompiled info, I've included a .bat script and a clean  generated file called CINFO_GEN.BIN, run startup.bat to get the dump file.
